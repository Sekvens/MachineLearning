\section*{Task 1: Genetic Algorithms}

\subsection*{Question 1} 

\emph{Think about what each of the genetic operators means for this
simplistic genome. Geometrically speaking, what would a 1-point crossover look like in this case? What about mutation?}

\textbf{Answer:} When considering the selection, a good fitness function would be to max the radius to the closest star. Ranking would then be the different coordinates sorted from the largest to the smallest radius and we could select an individual with a probability weighted on the rank. 

For reproduction we would just select one individual and copy it to the population.
% (0704) (1513) = (1504) (0713) = 0703 1514 = 0513 1704

For recombination we would select two individuals and perform a crossover. A 1-point selection would geometrically have a few different outcomes depending on were the crossover is performed and how the genome is encoded. The most simple representation would be that the $x_i$ and $y_i$ coordinate of the parent $i$ would be crossed over with the second parent $j$'s coordinates. This would result geometrically with the new individual(s) becoming align with one parent on the x-axis and the other parent on the y-axis. 

We can however imagine more complex representations of the genome that would create more complex crossovers.

A restriction could be that we are not allowed to recombine to a new individual located outside the grid, avoiding memory issues.

Mutation would be to select an individual and introducing some noise into its coordinates. This would produce a new individual that would be more or less a random coordinate but biased to keep many similarities with the original parent. This should be restricted to only produce coordinates within our grid. 

\subsection*{Question 2}
\emph{Would you expect more improvement in this problem to result
from crossovers or mutations? Why? Is that what you would normally expect?}

\textbf{Answer:} Depending on the way we define the crossover it could be hard to cover all the search space with only the crossover operator. The data is scattered randomly in the search space and each individual doesn't contain useful information encoded in its genome that future generations can benefit from. With this crossover implementation we think mutation does us more good since it's similar to a random search.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Question 3}
\emph{What are the possible sources of population diversity when using
genetic algorithms? How do are those sources of diversity reflected in the shape of the diversity curve in your plot?}

\textbf{Answer:} 
Firstly the population diversity can be initialised by random starting positions of the nodes. Secondly crossover and mutation increases the diversity and the peaks in our graph are when the crossover or mutation have lead us to a better solution, increasing the diversity of the general population. 

\subsection*{Question 4}
\emph{Why is population diversity important?}

\textbf{Answer:} Without diversity we can't use the differences of the genomes as much as if we have a lot of diversity. So a good diversity in the start help us not get stuck at a maxima/minima as much as a bad diversity would since the diversity would allow us to faster try other solutions.

\subsection*{Question 5}
\emph{What's the difference between rank and proportional selection?
Why does that make rank based selection better at avoiding premature convergence?}

\textbf{Answer:} In proportional selection the probability of getting selected is directly dependent on the fitness of that individual. In ranked based selection we use the rank-order of the fitness among the individuals to determine the probability, not relying on absolute fitness values. Selection with ranked selection is therefore independent of the actual fitness values and the best individual will not dominate the selection process. %TODO reference to the book.

\subsection*{Question 6}
\emph{What selection pressure resulted in the most promising looking
diversity curve? Run the algorithm a few more times using that pressure setting. What was the best fitness value and position you were able to locate?}

\textbf{Answer:} We think that a pressure of 1.5 looks most promising as seen in \ref{fig:plot2Diversity15}. Another good candidate is the pressure value of 1.25 \ref{fig:plot2Diversity125}. The big question here is what we consider the problem to be. Are we looking for the optimal solution or just a good solution? Another consideration is how much computational time do we have? 

A steep diversity curve as in \ref{fig:plot2Diversity2} leads to a fast convergence which most likely means it takes the first good enough solution and optimize for that one. A less steep one means we are considering more less fit nodes for a longer time, giving us more time to search the space for a better solution and thus increasing the probability of eventually the globally optimal solution.

An argument why we like the 1.25 solution is that it still contains some spikes after the first steep decent of the slope. This suggest that it's still searching quite a lot for better solutions and thus giving it more generations to run means it could eventually find better solutions.

\subsection*{Question 7}
\emph{What affect does an elitist strategy have on the progress of fitness values?}

 \textbf{Answer: } The best fitness value cannot decrease with an elitist strategy. The average fitness is increased more steeply with an elitism strategy and faster catches up with the best value.

\subsection*{Question 8}
\emph{Report the generation the best individual was born in, and whether
it was created by crossover or mutation, for the each of the elitist and non-elitist trials. What differences, if any, do you observe between the two methods?}

\textbf{Answer: } As seen in \ref{table:tableElitist} we can assume that elitist leads more often to crossover but we can't really make any conclusions with such a small dataset.
 
\subsection*{Question 9}
\emph{What settings did you use? How well did the solver perform on
the more difficult maps? Explain any difference in performance you observed.}

\textbf{Answer:}  The selection function is ranked with a pressure of 1.5 and two parents. We are swapping the coordinates of $x$ and $y$ as a crossover operator and we have a mutation probability of $0.3\%$. 

\section*{Task 2: Minimizing a Function}

\subsection*{Question 10}
\emph{Why would the global minimum be difficult to find using a gradient descent method?}

\textbf{Answer:} The fact that the global minimum is very tightly by local
minima makes it almost impossible to find for a single searcher that is
following the slopes without falling down into one of the surrounding local 
minima. 


\subsection*{Question 11}
\emph{What effect does the choice of crossover operation appear to
have on the population diversity?}

\textbf{Answer:} gly suspect that the bottom left one and the top left one are connected since the lines of the separation fits very good with each other. This means it's only 5 different actual clusters. If we imagine the 2D neural network as a paper it have connected two corners on one side and created a loop where the edges are against each other.

\subsection*{Question 12}
\emph{Which (if any) of the dynamic mutation probability strategies
improved the performance of the algorithm? What difference do you observe in the results?}

\textbf{Answer:} We used the \texttt{plotsomhits} with the trained SOM and the points as input parameters. If we compare their location we can see that point 1 and 4 are close to each other. Point 3 and 5 are very close to each other as well but are far away from 1 and 4. Point 2 is placed in the top left corner so it could belong to a separated cluster or possible to the same class as 3 and 5 the bottom left corner.

\subsection*{Question 13}
\emph{Describe the effect (if any) comparative selection has on population diversity and convergence.} 

\textbf{Answer:}

\subsection*{Question 14}

well does it perform now? Can you improve the performance?} 

\textbf{Answer:}

\textbf{Answer:}

\section*{Task 4: Global Trajectory Optimisation}

\subsection*{Question 23}
\emph{Before trying to solve this problem, make a hypothesis. Consider what little you know about the problem. Now, make an educated guess: what is one choice for setting up either GA or PSO which you think might lead to better performance on this problem? For example, you could hypothesize that a particular crossover operation will be more effective than the others, or that higher values of social attraction will improve PSO performance. Your choice needs to be something you can test in matlab , and should be more than simply changing the number of iterations or population size. Briefly explain why you
think that your choice might make a difference on this problem. (Note that there isnâ€™t a right or wrong answer here.)}
