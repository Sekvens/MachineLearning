hey ami , we have a little issue on transco regarding devon production . does
your contact @ devon know if we are responsible for scheduling pvr for them .
please read note below and let me know if we need to talk to anyone on our
side . thanks !
fyi ,
transco has called wanting to know who is responsible for nominating devon ' s
pvr . we do not have access to their contracts to do
the noms . ces use to have transco do it for them and so did we for january
and february , but nothing was nominated for march or april . i
mentioned this to nelson and dan junek back in march , but nothing was
decided . at one time , devon did not want to give us access to nominate
their pvr because they did not want us to have access to any of their
information . could you find out if we are responsible for the pvr and if we
are , they
have to make us agent to nominate on those particular contracts ? maybe you
will have better luck than i did .
thanks ,
