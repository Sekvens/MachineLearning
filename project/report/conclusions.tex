\section{Conclusions}

We had the theory that spam messages can be recognized without involving the
specific words in messages. The result shows that is possible.
The result also shows the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Mapping the range of each individual dimension to
    the output range turns out to be very important for this application.
  \item The network manages to classify messages with very little information
    about the messages. 
\end{enumerate}

It turns out normalizing each individual dimension to a common range helped the
network by a great deal. Since we are trying to generalize features of a
string and don't necessarily care about some individual protruding feature, we
don't loose important information because of this. It instead helps when
clustering the dataset.
\\ 
The more surprising result is how little the network needed to know about the
message in order to classify it correctly. A common concern when training ANN
is if the dataset is linearly separable, especially if input dimension $<<<$
number of data points. The results show that the messages were successfully
separated in four dimensions. 
\\ 
Shrinking the feature vector also has another implication: Training a network
in this fashion is rather fast. It took less than 2.5 seconds for Matlab to
train a network with the used parameters. This means that a system using this
technique could be dynamically modified when new data were introduced.
