\section{Project Goals} 
  The goal of this project is to study how Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) can
  be trained to recognize spam messages, and to implement a well-performing
  spam-filter using ANN.

\section{Shortcomings}
  In this project, a single dataset of messages were used. Even though the
  dataset contained a wide variety of messages, it would obviously have been
  interesting consider more than one dataset.  
  \begin{itemize} 
    \item Train different networks with datasets with the same parameters and
      study the performance of the networks.
    \item Study how a trained network performed when trained with different
    datasets.  
    \item Find out which features that seems to be most important
      for a general dataset. 
  \end{itemize}
