\section{Background}
Now days most people are aware of the meaning of spam messages. According to a recent report from M\textsuperscript{3}AAWG percentage of e-mails that they classified as abusive between 2012-2014 have been between $87-90\%$ \cite{M3AAWG2014}. Spam exists in many other forms of communication like SMS text messages, chats, social media and many more.

The goal of most spam is to advertise a product in a cheap way to a large number of recipient. Since spam advertisement is considered unethical most companies would not want to be associated with spam. Therefore it's generally more shady products that are being advertised like diets, hoax products, pornography, escort services or pharmaceutical products from unreliable distributors.
Some of these products can be dangerous for the recipients but there are as well spam that are purely intended to harm the recipient through scams or with the intent of stealing or hijacking information.
Other issues why spam should be stopped is that it's wasting time and bandwidth. 
Currently there are many organizations that are working with preventing spam reaching the recipient.
Justin M. Rao and David H. Reiley \cite{rao2012economics} have estimated that the gross revenue of the worldwide spam advertisement is in the order of \$200 million per year and this number would be far greater if it wasn't for the current prevention efforts.
The most efficient way to stop spam is to create programs that are called anti-spam filters. 
Black-lists where a common anti-spam filter technique which have had a limited effect since spammers usually change identity on the internet.
Context-based filters was another common technique that is searching for patterns common in spam messages, the drawback with these technique are that these patterns have to be hand written and that the spammers usually adapt their spam messages to avoid detection.
