  \subsection{Network performance with initial parameters}
  \label{sec:initialresults}
    \begin{table}[h]
    \begin{tabular}{llll}
    Run               & Overall Success & Spam Success & Ham Success \\
    Both Lists        & 84.24\%         & 79.37\%      & 83.07\%     \\
    Banned Word List  & 86.37\%         & 67.31\%      & 92.75\%     \\
    Link Word List    & 82.86\%         & 68.34\%      & 86.50\%     \\
    None of the Lists & 83.83\%         & 48.66\%      & 96.01\%    
    \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
    As shown, introducing extra features for checking for common spam words and
    links increased the network performance. The network still has troubles
    classifying some messages, mainly spam messages.
  \subsection{Network performance with reworked parameters}
  \label{sec:reworkedresults}
    With the reworked paramters, the performance of the network increased
    drastically. Over 10 sample runs, the total percentage of missclassified
    messages were never less than 2\%. In one run, the network managed to
    classify the whole set of messages correctly.
