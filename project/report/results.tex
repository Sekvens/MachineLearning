\section{Results}
  After running our tests we can see that the word list with the banned words
  are greatly increasing the chance of classifying spam messages correctly. The
  word list that identifies links have a much smaller impact but improves the
  spam classification slightly. 
  \begin{table}[h]
  \begin{tabular}{llll}
  Run               & Overall Success & Spam Success & Ham Success \\
  Both Lists        & 84.24\%         & 79.37\%      & 83.07\%     \\
  Banned Word List  & 86.37\%         & 67.31\%      & 92.75\%     \\
  Link Word List    & 82.86\%         & 68.34\%      & 86.50\%     \\
  None of the Lists & 83.83\%         & 48.66\%      & 96.01\%    
  \end{tabular}
